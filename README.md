## A QR code based distributed anonymous credential application. 
***
#### Consider a scenario where the user interacts with the service provider by displaying or scanning a QR code on their mobile phone, which contains the identity proof and the service request. 

Our approach utilizes a two-step verification process, encompassing both user identity authentication and the validation of specific required associated information. Together with these components, we develop an effective solution to support privacy-preserving QR code verification, as illustrated at a low level in Figure a, as well as a high level idea of our solution in the Figure b below. Fig c illustrates a QR code from the user who is entering a pub to verify he has a valid credential and is over 18 years old. The QR code has error correction level L (Low), and contains a zero-knowledge proof generated by Plonk plus other insensitive necessary information. For the access criteria proven QR code, it embeds the Plonk range proofs. It contains important information shows below:

- **Transcript**: The required *transcript* for Plonk includes the commitments, which are actually points(a pair of value x, y) on the elliptic curve, along with several field elements required to complete the verification process.
- **Protocol name**: e.g. *Plonk*. The application is able to support variable protocols.
- **Curve name**: e.g. *bn128*. The application is able to support variable curves if the curve is compatible with use on a smart contract.
- **Public signal**: the public parameters if available.

We implement our smart contract in Solidity and deploy our contract on the test Ethereum network, set the security parameter $\lambda = 128$. Plonk proof was constructed over alt-BabyJubjub BN128 elliptic curve. We use the Poseidon hash function to generate the challenges.
